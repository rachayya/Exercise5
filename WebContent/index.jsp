	<h1>Testpitara</h1>
	<p id="tagline">The Java platform and language began as an internal
		project at Sun Microsystems in December 1990, providing an alternative
		to the C++ or C programming languages. Engineer Patrick Naughton had
		become increasingly frustrated with the state of Sun's C++ and C
		application programming interfaces (APIs) and tools. While considering
		moving to NeXT, Naughton was offered[by whom?] a chance to work on new
		technology, and thus the Stealth Project started. The Stealth Project
		was soon renamed to the Green Project, with James Gosling and Mike
		Sheridan joining Naughton. Together with other engineers, they began
		work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California.
		They aimed to develop new technology for programming next-generation
		smart appliances, which Sun expected to offer major new opportunities.
		The team originally considered using C++, but rejected it for several
		reasons. Because they were developing an embedded system with limited
		resources, they decided that C++ needed too much memory and that its
		complexity led to developer errors. The language's lack of garbage
		collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system
		memory, a challenging and error-prone task. The team also worried
		about the C++ language's lack of portable facilities for security,
		distributed programming, and threading. Finally, they wanted a
		platform that would port easily to all types of devices..

	<h2>What's the meaning of life?</h2>
	<P id="tagline">The meaning of life, or the answer to the question
		"What is the meaning of life?", pertains to the significance of living
		or existence in general. Many other related questions include "Why are
		we here?", "What is life all about?", and "What is the purpose of
		existence?" or even "Does life exist at all?" There have been a large
		number of proposed answers to these questions from many different
		cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning
		has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and
		metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and
		cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.
		Most religions believe that life is a test from God. Some believe the
		prosperous journey of adjustment to any given environment to develop a
		sense of comfort and happiness in which enables reproduction and the
		ability to influence what you create, can be understood as the meaning
		of life. The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from our
		philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries
		about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other
		issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value,
		purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or
		multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
		Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related
		empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and
		parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can
		provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related
		conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the
		question, "What is the meaning of my life?"</P>
